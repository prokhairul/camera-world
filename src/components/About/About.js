                    The Fujifilm X-T10 is a DSLR-styled mirrorless camera announced by Fujifilm on May 18, 2015. It is a smaller, lighter and more affordable alternative to the Fujifilm X-T1 with which it shares a sensor and processor. The X-T10 lacks the X-T1's weather sealing and electronic shutter and has a smaller viewfinder and lower resolution LCD. In January 2017, Fujifilm announced the X-T20 as the successor to the X-T10.
